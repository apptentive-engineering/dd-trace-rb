## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation in the Datadog's [private repository][docs]

[docs]: http://gems.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/

## Getting started

### Install

If you're using ``Bundler``, just update your ``Gemfile`` as follows:

```ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    # tracing gem
    gem 'ddtrace', :source => 'http://gems.datadoghq.com/trace/'
```

### Rails Quickstart (manual instrumentation)

If you aren't using a supported framework instrumentation, you may want to to manually instrument your code.
Adding tracing to your code is very simple. As an example, letâ€™s imagine we have a web server and we want
to trace requests to the home page:

```ruby
    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'activerecord'

    # a generic tracer that you can use across your application
    tracer = Datadog.tracer

    get '/' do
      tracer.trace('web.request') do |span|
        # set some span metadata
        span.service = 'my-web-site'
        span.resource = '/'
        span.set_tag('http.method', request.request_method)

        # trace the activerecord call
        tracer.trace('posts.fetch') do
          @posts = Posts.order(created_at: :desc).limit(10)
        end

        # trace the template rendering
        tracer.trace('template.render') do
          erb :index
        end
      end
    end
```

### Redis Quickstart

By default, our monkey-patching is not active, you need to either:

- set the env var `DATADOG_TRACE_AUTOPATCH=true`
- explicitly activate it by calling `Datadog::Monkey.patch_all` or `Datadog::Monkey.patch_module`

This ultimately allows you to enable or disable tracing on a per-library basis.

The example below shows the Redis case, but any other non-rails library
should work the same way:

```ruby

    require 'redis'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_all # you need to explicitly patch it

    # now do your Redis stuff, eg:
    redis = Redis.new
    redis.set 'foo', 'bar' # traced!
```

## Development

### Testing

Configure your environment through:

    $ bundle install
    $ appraisal install

You can launch all tests using the following rake command:

    $ rake test                       # tracer tests
    $ appraisal rake rails            # tests Rails matrix
    $ appraisal contrib rake contrib  # tests other contrib libraries (Redis, ...)
    $ appraisal contrib rake monkey   # tests monkey patching

Available appraisals are:

* ``rails{3,4,5}-postgres``: Rails with PostgreSQL
* ``rails{3,4,5}-mysql2``: Rails with MySQL
* ``contrib``: Other contrib libraries (Redis, ...)

jRuby includes only Rails 3.x and 4.x because the current implementation of jdbc drivers, don't support
ActiveRecord 5.x.

The test suite requires many backing services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, ...) and we're using
``docker`` and ``docker-compose`` to start these services in the CI.
To launch properly the test matrix, please [install docker][2] and [docker-compose][3] using
the instructions provided by your platform. Then launch them through:

    $ docker-compose up -d

We also enforce the Ruby [community-driven style guide][1] through Rubocop. Simply launch:

    $ rake rubocop
